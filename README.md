# lvt_projects
This is a repository for data science projects for Li-Vern Teo


# Environment set up 
My preferred set up is Jupyter Notebooks in virtual environments. I use the following to set up my virtual environment (named env)

`python3 -m venv env`

Installing the packages needed to run Jupyter Notebooks in this repository

`pip install requirements.txt`


# Repository set up 
Each folder in the repository consists of standalone projects. It will have all the dat files necessary to run the code in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

(In my local set up, I have a Postgres database that I use to perform queries on my database. I've extracted .csv copies of the queries used in for the analysis  to containerise these projects)
