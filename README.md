# Data Science Projects
This is a repository for data science projects for Li-Vern Teo


# Environment set up 
My preferred set up is Jupyter Notebooks in virtual environments. I use the following to set up my virtual environment (named env)

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Packages needed to run all notebooks in this repository are in the `requirements.txt` file

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


# Repository set up 
Each folder in the repository consists of standalone projects. It will have all the dat files necessary to run the code in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

> I sometimes use a local Postgres database to store the datasets I find online. I've extracted .csv copies of the outputs used in the Jupyter to containerise these projects
