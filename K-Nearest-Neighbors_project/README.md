# K-Nearest-Neighbours 
The data and problem statement for this project were provided in the [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) by Jose Portilla on Udemy.

### About this project 
Applying KNN classification to a set of anonymised data to predict the `TARGET CLASS` outcome (either 1/0)
This project will consist of: 
* Preparing the data set with a scaler
* Applying KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn 
* Using the elbow method to find the optimum K value for the data set
